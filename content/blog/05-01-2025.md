Today, I wanted to create my own personal website.

I used Hugo since it seemed like a cool static site generator in a language that I have not tried yet (Go).

I was trying to change the config file (hugo.toml), but everytime I changed the title:

```toml
baseURL = 'https://lapizote.mooo.com/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'Lapizote's Space'
theme = 'lappyMini'
```

I would get an error whenever I would try to build it. Notice the issue yet? The markdown engine should've probably pointed out the issue already. VSCode did not point it out.

I spent 20 minutes looking for the error. I am an absolute fucking imbecile.
